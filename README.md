# UpGoerWriter

## Making hard words into easy words

Up Goer Writer is a tool to (attempt to) translate standard English into text consisting over only the top 1000 most used English words (inspired by Randall Munroe's [similarly named comic](https://xkcd.com/1133/))

Currently, only the simplest approach (examining each word individually and replacing with the closest match) is implemented. In the future I hope to make improvements.

Try it yourself by downloading, installing the python requirements and running `python test/10_sentences_spacy.py`
