The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
I was working in my lab late one night, when my eyes beheld an eerie sight
Though I cannot see I can hear her smile as she sings
She says nothing at all, but simply stares upward into the dark sky and watches, with sad eyes, the slow dance of the infinite stars
The sun rose slowly, as if it wasn't sure it was worth all the effort
It is a truth, universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
To make a thief, make an owner; to create crime, create laws
As the man said, for every complex problem there is a simple solution, and it's wrong
Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible
